# GitHub MCP Server

**Deprecation Notice:** Development for this project has been moved to GitHub in the http://github.com/github/github-mcp-server repo.

---

MCP Server for the GitHub API, enabling file operations, repository management, search functionality, and more.

### Features

- **Automatic Branch Creation**: When creating/updating files or pushing changes, branches are automatically created if they don't exist
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Clear error messages for common issues
- **Git History Preservation**: Operations maintain proper Git history without force pushing
- **Batch Operations**: Support for both single-file and multi-file operations
- **Advanced Search**: Support for searching code, issues/PRs, and users
- **Multi-User Support**: Each tool call can be authenticated with a different GitHub Personal Access Token, allowing for concurrent use by multiple users.

## Authentication

This server supports two methods of authentication:

1.  **Environment Variable (Single-User)**: You can set the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable when running the server. This token will be used for all operations.

2.  **Per-Tool Authentication (Multi-User)**: For multi-user environments, you can pass a `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` as a parameter to any tool call. This token will be used for that specific operation, overriding the environment variable if it is set.

This is made possible by using Node.js's `AsyncLocalStorage` API, which creates a unique, isolated context for each request. This ensures that even with many concurrent users, each user's token is used only for their own operations, with no risk of data leakage.

### How to Use for Multi-User Scenarios

To use this feature, simply include the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` parameter in the arguments of your tool call. For example:

```json
{
  "tool_name": "create_repository",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "my-new-repo",
    "description": "A repository for my project",
    "private": true,
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_YourUserSpecificTokenHere"
  }
}
```

If a tool is called without this parameter, the server will fall back to using the token from the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Architectural Design: `AsyncLocalStorage`

The multi-user authentication in this server is built using Node.js's `AsyncLocalStorage` API. This design was chosen for its robustness, maintainability, and safety in concurrent environments.

### Comparison with Alternative Approaches

An alternative to `AsyncLocalStorage` is "prop-drilling," which involves passing the token as a parameter through every function in the call stack. The table below compares the two approaches:

| Criterion | Prop-Drilling Approach | `AsyncLocalStorage` Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Code Changes** | **High.** Required modifying every file in `operations/`, plus `utils.ts` and `index.ts`. | **Low.** Only required changes in `index.ts`, `utils.ts`, and the creation of one new context file. `operations/` files were untouched. |
| **Maintainability** | **Poor.** Adding a new tool would require remembering to add the token parameter to its schema and function signature, which is error-prone. | **Excellent.** New tools work automatically without any special consideration for authentication. The logic is centralized. |
| **Readability** | **Cluttered.** Function signatures were filled with a `token` parameter that was irrelevant to their core business logic, making them noisy. | **Clean.** The functions in `operations/` are clean and focused only on their specific task (e.g., creating an issue). |
| **Concurrency Safety** | **Manually Safe.** It was safe from race conditions, but only because we manually passed the correct token for each request. This relies on developer discipline. | **Inherently Safe.** The entire pattern is designed for concurrency. Node.js guarantees that each request's context is isolated, eliminating the possibility of race conditions. |

While prop-drilling is more explicit, `AsyncLocalStorage` provides a superior architecture that is cleaner, more scalable, and less prone to developer error. It is the modern, standard way to handle request-scoped context in Node.js.

## Setup

### Personal Access Token
[Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with appropriate permissions:
   - Go to [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (in GitHub Settings > Developer settings)
   - Select which repositories you'd like this token to have access to (Public, All, or Select)
   - Create a token with the `repo` scope ("Full control of private repositories")
     - Alternatively, if working only with public repositories, select only the `public_repo` scope
   - Copy the generated token
